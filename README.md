# Intro_to_TDA
Introduction to Topological Data Analysis.

The first uploaded file is a vague attempt to see how packages like ripser work. It doesn't work on large datasets (from my experience) and categorical data is not very friendly for this (according to the results which we can see in the file).

I have also tried PCA after categorising the data and I am not sure if it is coherent or not with the TDA since for the later part I used a small sample of the data only.
