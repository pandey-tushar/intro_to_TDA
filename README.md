Introduction to Topological Data Analysis
This is a working repository in topological data analysis. It focusses on some basic aspects of Ripser package and Mapper(kepler mapper package)
Some interactive html files are added which are generated with the help of mapper. The code is also available to look at in order to better 
understand how it works. 
If someone wants to know the mathematics behind TDA, feel free to contact me.
