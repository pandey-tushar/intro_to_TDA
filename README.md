Introduction to Topological Data Analysis

This is a working repository in topological data analysis. It focusses on some basic aspects of Ripser package and Mapper(kepler mapper package).

Some interactive html files are added which are generated with the help of mapper. The code is also available to look at in order to better understand how it works.

I have also tried to automate the hyperparameter selection which reduces the number of hyperparameters from around 10 to 2. And those two hyperparameters are easy to understand since it's the mean and variance of node_valency in the output graph. There is a possibility to further improve it by using both the average variance for the entire graph and the variance for the largest connected component.
